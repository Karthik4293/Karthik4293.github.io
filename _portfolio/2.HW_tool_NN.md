<i>A low level software to generate hardware design scripts for Neural Networks.</i>
### October 2017
---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
A hardware generation tool was implemented in C++ to generate the hardware description script (in System Verilog) for three layered neural network. The design was capable of generating the hardware script for varying port selection and parallelism. 
The emphasis of the project was to dynamically implement multiple stages of pipeline and parallelism according to user input.

I was responsible for the design and implementation of pipelined matrix vector multiplier(MVM) and parsing memory module through C++ which was later used in the development of Neural Network.
This project was a course work for an advanced course on Digital System Generation (ESE-507) conducted by Prof. Peter Milder. The generated scripts were compiled and synthesized on , Standard Cell Design Compiler library (NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical) by Synopsys Inc.
