<i>Motion detection using Raspberry Pi and Camera module V2 for RPI.</i>

<p>A network infrastructure is built using camera sensors to track the direction of motion of an object. By having multiple nodes, each with substantial processing capability, the computational context becomes distributed. This distributed approach of computation leads to several benefits, mainly the reduction of the network congestion and enhanced accuracy of the results. By keeping a minimal load of the information transferred, the communication overhead is severely reduced (As compared to a master-slave architecture).</p>

I was responsible for implementing the functionalities of the sensor node.
  * The Sensor nodes were built using Raspberry Pi Zero(W) and a camera module V2 supporting Pi. Feature selection and acquisition was done using the Histogram of Gradients(HOG) classifier. 
  * After determining the direction of the motion of person, a control signal is sent to a next-hop node along same direction. The control signal includes all the characteristic features of the object under scrutiny.
