<i>Implementation of Cannon's method for matrix multiplication on SeaWulf supercomputer at Stony Brook University.</i>
### December 2017

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>Matrix multiplication was implemented on 2 large uniformly distributed random dense matrices using Cannon's method and Fox's method. The size of the square matrices were varied from 0.1 million to 0.5 million.</p>  
The algorithms were implemented using MPI library with C on SEAWULF HPC Cluster at Stony Brook University. Computing resources for SeaWulf can be found on the following link.

<p>This project was part of the coursework for "The Principles of Parallel Computing AMS : 530". The emphasis of the project was to get accustomed to working in supercomputing environments.</p>
