<i>A wrapper template that supports murmur3 hashing for all primitive data types</i>
### March 2018

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The hash key for a tuple consisting of generic data is generated using MurMur3 hashing algorithm.  
<p>MurmurHash is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup. It was created by Austin Appleby in 2008[4] and is currently hosted on Github along with its test suite named 'SMHasher'. It also exists in a number of variants, all of which have been released into the public domain.</p>
>(as cited on wikipedia)

The project implements a wraparound template (and consequently its class) which can take a tuple with unspecified datatypes, as its input and generate a 32 bit or a 128 bit hash key depending on the specified platform.   
The aim of the project is to demonstrate the proficiency in C++ 11 and it's features such as, variadic templates and template specialization.
