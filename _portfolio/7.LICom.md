<i>Transferring data bits over visible light channel.</i>
### August 2013

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<p>Designed and Implemented a Wireless Visible Light Communication(VLC) system that transferred data bits over the visible light channel.</p>

<p>The communication in VLC takes place by modulating the intensity of the LED light in such a way that it is undetectable to the human eyes. A photo sensitive detector which demodulates the light signal into electronic form is used as a receiver.</p>

1. A driver circuit was designed to drive OOK modulated white LED.
2. The receivers were designed and calibrated to account for the noise from ambient light.

The project was submitted at "Analog design contest - 2013" conducted by Texas Instruments.
