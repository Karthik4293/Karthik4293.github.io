<i>Book Finder: An interactive application to find book reviews.</i>
### March 2018

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>An android application was built to find the reviews of a book in real time using the camera.</p>
  
<p>My responsibilities included writing the python functions (Stiching Cloudsight and Goodreads API's together along with web scraping for obtaining the unique book ID) which was later deployed on the cloud. The project was coursework for an advanced course on Mobile cloud computing (ESE 543).</p>
