SONY CELL is a x64 multicore microprocessor which was based on Broadband Engine Architecture(BEA) and was commercially featured in Playstation 3.
The Synergistic Processor Unit (SPU) is the integral part of CELL and is designed to accelerate the media and streaming workloads.  

This project aims to design and implement the behavioral model SPU-lite multimedia processor in System Verilog.
