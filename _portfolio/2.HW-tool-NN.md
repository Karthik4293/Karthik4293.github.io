<i>A low level software to generate hardware design scripts for Neural Networks.</i>
### October 2017
---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>A hardware generation tool was implemented in C++ to generate the hardware description script (in System Verilog) for three layered neural network. The design was capable of generating the hardware script for varying port selection and parallelism.</p>  
<br/>
<p>The emphasis of the project was to dynamically implement multiple stages of pipeline and parallelism according to user input.</p>
<br/>
<p>I was responsible for the design and implementation of pipelined matrix vector multiplier(MVM) and parsing memory module through C++ which was later used in the development of Neural Network. </p> 
<br/>
<p>This project was a course work for an advanced course on Digital System Generation (ESE-507) conducted by Prof. Peter Milder. The generated scripts were compiled and synthesized on , Standard Cell Design Compiler library (NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical) by Synopsys Inc.</p>
