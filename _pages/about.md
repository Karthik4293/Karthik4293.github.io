Hello Visitor,

Thanks for spending time on my corner of the internet. I am a Computer Engineering graduate at Stony Brook University.

During my early days of undergraduate studies, when I was working on computer vision projects, the excruciatingly slow render times fueled my passion for parallel computing. Trying to get an optimized code, increasing the efficiency of an algorithm, solving puzzles are somethings that I tend to get indulged in. Being an enthusiast at the field of HPC, I have always tried to look at the bigger picture of its applications. Interested by some of the evolving technologies of today such as heterogeneous computing systems, AI, machine learning, I find myself trying to extend their boundaries by the application of HPC and machine level abstractions.

Also, I am a huge hiking buff. I have completed several high-altitude trekking in the mighty Himalayas. Having said that, I am not all about persevering through the most inclement weather. Iâ€™m an easy going jovial guy, who knows a bit of guitar too. I am interested in meeting and interacting with people.

good day
